# Report: CORD-19 Data Analysis

## üìå Overview

In this project, I explored the **CORD-19 metadata.csv dataset** which contains information about COVID-19 research papers.  
The goal was to practice loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing real-world data, and to display the results in a simple **Streamlit app**.

## üîç Findings

- **Publication Trends:** Most papers were published between 2020 and 2021, showing the peak of COVID-19 research activity.  
- **Top Journals:** A few journals published the majority of papers (e.g., medRxiv, bioRxiv, The Lancet).  
- **Common Words:** Titles often included words such as *health*, *pandemic*, *response*, and *vaccine*.  
- **Abstract Lengths:** Abstracts varied widely, but many papers had detailed abstracts with hundreds of words.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used

- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** for data handling and visualization  
- **Streamlit** for the interactive web app  
- **VS Code** as the development environment  
- **GitHub** for version control and sharing

## ‚ú® Reflection

This assignment helped me practice:  

- Setting up a Python environment in VS Code  
- Cleaning messy datasets (handling missing values, converting dates)  
- Making simple but clear visualizations  
- Building my first Streamlit dashboard  
- Uploading and documenting my work on GitHub  

### Challenges

- Handling missing values in some columns  
- Running Streamlit for the first time  
- Learning how to activate virtual environments in PowerShell  

Overall, this project gave me confidence in the **data analysis workflow**: load ‚Üí clean ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí visualize ‚Üí share.
